THIS CODE IS A POC AND VERY DIRTY ATM AND WILL BE CLEANED IN THE FUTURE

This is needed for frida
`sudo nvram boot-args="-arm64e_preview_abi"`

If you want to test:
1. `frida -l inject.js UIKitSystem` (This patch is needed for GUI)
2. `make clean all`
3. `DYLD_SHARED_REGION=1 ./build/runner app.app/app`
